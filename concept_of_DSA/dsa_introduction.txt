some basic terminologies

1. Data structure :- these are a way to arrange data in main memory for effecient usage.

2. Algorithm :- sequence of steps to solve a given problem

3. database :- collection of permanent storage for faster retrival and updation

4. database warehouse :- management of huge amount  of legacy data for better analayis

5. Time complexity ---> time taken by Algorithm TO execute it effeciently with 
the increase of input

why time complexity ??
--> for making better programs
-->for comparision of Algorithm

6. big O  notation (upper bound):- a function f(n) is said to  be  big O g(n)  
iff there exist constant c and a constant n such that 
                        0 <= f(n) <= c * g(n)

in big o notation means ki wrost case ab isse upper nhi jayega

7. theta Q notation :- (average -case complexity)

8. omega notation : - (lower bounnd complexity)
